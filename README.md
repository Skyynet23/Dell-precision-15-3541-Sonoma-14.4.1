## Disclamers:

I'm not responsible for any bricked devices, dead hard drives, Special Military Operation, or your project getting delayed because the whole thing won't boot up.

YOU are choosing to make these modifications with my setup, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device with my EFI setup, I will pray for you being dumb.

Your Apple ID might be restricted/banned by Apple, there's nothing to do with me.

Your warranty might be void when you have already fiddled with your device. If the whole laptop dies, bad luck with you.
